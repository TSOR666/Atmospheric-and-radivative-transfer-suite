# Security Policy

We take the security of this project seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

We currently support the latest minor version series. Older series receive fixes on a best‑effort basis only.

- 0.1.x: supported (security fixes and critical bug fixes)
- < 0.1: unsupported

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Do not file public GitHub issues for security problems.
- Please submit a private report using GitHub Security Advisories:
  - https://github.com/tsor/atmospheric-radiative-transfer-suite/security/advisories/new
- If you cannot use the advisory workflow, contact the maintainers privately via the contact listed in `CITATION.cff` or `README.md`.

When reporting, include as much detail as possible:

- Affected files and versions (commit SHA or tag)
- Reproduction steps and a minimal proof‑of‑concept
- Impact assessment (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
- Any known mitigations or workarounds

We will acknowledge your report within 7 days and aim to provide a remediation plan within 30 days. Coordinated disclosure timelines may vary depending on complexity and ecosystem impact.

## Scope

This policy covers vulnerabilities in the project’s source code, configuration, and build/packaging scripts. Issues in third‑party dependencies should be reported upstream to the respective projects; we will track and mitigate their impact here.

## Safe Harbor

We support good‑faith security research. If you comply with this policy, we will not pursue legal action against you for your research. Avoid data exfiltration, privacy violations, or service disruption, and make a best effort to avoid accessing, modifying, or destroying data.
